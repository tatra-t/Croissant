        <p> A croissant is a buttery, flaky,
        French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
        dough.[2] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
        several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
        layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. </p>
        <p> Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity[3] but
        using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern
        croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
        yeast-leavened laminated dough.[4] </p> 
        <p>In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
        dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
        Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold
        in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[6]

        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
